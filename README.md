# Simple Telegram publisher

An [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) for publish text messages and photos in a telegram
channel once a day by date.

App uses Google Sheets as data source. You can see a
sample [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1__hfCBTHxZV8rLN2HnVAZJLkZ1ZbPxmVvq2tuD2-an4/edit?usp=sharing).

The project has a flat structure without es6 modules because of current Google Apps Script restrictions.
